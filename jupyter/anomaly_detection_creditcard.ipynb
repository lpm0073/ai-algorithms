    "# Anomaly Detection in Azure ML Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "Example anomaly detection machine learning job using a hybrid of Azure AI Machine Learning console resources combined with native Python in this Jupyter notebook which is intended to be uploaded and executed from 'Authoring -> Notebooks' in the web console. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should already have created an Azure account, and created a [Subscription](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/azure/understanding-azure-account-subscription-and-directory-/34800) and a [Workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-workspace?view=azureml-api-2).\n",
    "2. this exercise assumes that you've already downloaded the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset from kaggle, and stored this in 'Assets -> Data' inside your Azure account under the name, 'creditcard_fraud'.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks originated from the **IPython project**, which was created to provide an interactive computing environment for Python. Over time, it evolved into the broader **Jupyter Project** (\"JU\" for Julia, \"PY\" for Python, and \"R\" for R), supporting multiple programming languages. What makes Jupyter Notebooks so popular in data science is their ability to **combine code, outputs, text, math, and visualizations in one place**. This format is ideal for exploration, analysis, documentation, and teaching. Because of this flexibility and transparency, Jupyter has become a standard across cloud platforms like **Google Colab, Azure AI Machine Learning, and AWS SageMaker** — each offering hosted environments where users can write and execute notebooks with scalable cloud compute. These platforms support the same notebook format (.ipynb), making it easy to move your work between local machines and cloud services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, you can run this notebook from either of the Azure AI Machine Learning web console, or locally, assuming that you've created and activated the [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) provided in the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FullStackWithLawrence/ai-algorithms) for Python 3.13\n",

    "### Step 2: Load the Credit Card Fraud Dataset from Azure ML\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieve the dataset from our existing workspace, and set this up for use with Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT: be mindful of the size of the dataset that you're working with. For example, if you run this notebook locally then be aware that you're downloading around 150Mib from your Azure workspace. When running locally this snippet will take approximately 4 minutes to run.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Code Does\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Workspace.from_config()`** connects to your Azure ML workspace using the `config.json` file (you should already have this if you followed earlier lectures).\n",
    "- **`Dataset.get_by_name(...)`** loads the dataset you previously uploaded and registered in the Azure ML web interface.\n",
    "- **`.to_pandas_dataframe()`** converts the Azure Dataset into a standard pandas DataFrame so you can explore and manipulate it with Python.\n",
    "- **`df.head()`** shows the first 5 rows of the data — this is just a quick preview to confirm that the dataset loaded correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard pattern you’ll use throughout Azure ML when working with registered datasets in notebooks. It keeps your workflow consistent and lets you:\n",
    "- Avoid re-uploading data every time.\n",
    "- Ensure reproducibility across experiments and pipelines.\n",
    "- Easily switch to remote compute environments without changing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Console output\n",
    "\n",
    "You might (probably) see a few console output messages. This is expected. They come from Azure’s background systems for logging and monitoring.  \n",
    "Unless you see an actual `ERROR` or `Traceback`, you can **safely ignore** any of the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Warning: Falling back to use azure cli login credentials.`**  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **`{'infer_column_types': 'False', 'activity': 'to_pandas_dataframe'}`**  \n",
    "  - The dataset is being converted to a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "  - Azure is not auto-detecting column types.\n",
    "  - ✅ This means `to_pandas_dataframe()` is working.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Timeout was exceeded in force_flush().`**  \n",
    "  - A background telemetry system couldn’t send logging data in time.\n",
    "  - ✅ This is safe to ignore. It has no effect on your code or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Overriding of current TracerProvider / LoggerProvider / MeterProvider is not allowed`**  \n",
    "  - Azure's telemetry was already initialized; it's skipping a duplicate setup.\n",

    "- **`Attempting to instrument while already instrumented`**  \n",

    "\n",
    "The **Isolation Forest** algorithm is a popular unsupervised method for **detecting anomalies** in high-dimensional datasets. Instead of learning what “normal” looks like, it works by **isolating outliers** — rare points that are easier to separate from the rest of the data. It does this by randomly splitting the dataset using decision trees and measuring how quickly a data point can be isolated. The idea is that **anomalies require fewer splits to isolate**, because they are different from everything else. Isolation Forest is widely used in **fraud detection**, **network security**, and **industrial monitoring** because it is **fast, efficient**, and handles **large datasets** with many features. In our code, we set the `contamination` parameter to roughly match the known fraction of fraud cases in the dataset."
